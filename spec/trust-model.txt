zkputer trust model (v0.1.0)

1) What is zero-trust
- zk proof verification of computation integrity:
  "Given public inputs and a fixed circuit/version/key, this output was produced correctly."

2) What is trust-scoped
- Data provenance and source authenticity:
  Evidence can come from chain state, signed venue attestations, or unsigned APIs.
- Finality assumptions:
  Some venues/chains require confirmation windows or may reorg/rollback.
- Operational integrity:
  Key custody, build provenance, dependency integrity, and incident response.

3) Product language guardrail
- Preferred phrase:
  "Zero-trust compute verification with trust-scoped data provenance."
- Avoid absolute guarantee wording in legal/contractual text until policies and controls are complete.

4) Failure behavior
- Never fail-open on missing/conflicting evidence.
- Emit NON_PROVABLE with reason code and provenance diagnostics.
